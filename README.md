sort-it
=======

A game for a /r/dailyprogrammer challenge

Written in Python using pygame.

The idea is to play with different sorting techniques.

Currently only bubble sort is implemented.

You grab a rectangle by pressing space bar, and move that rectangle to its correct spot.

Release with another space bar press.

When the list is sorted, you win!

Upcoming features:
* Ability to select more than one rectangle (mimicking merge sort)
* Ability to move by more than one space (modified bubble sort)
* AI to battle you (can you sort in fewer moves than the computer)?
